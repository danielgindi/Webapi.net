Webapi.net
==========

A helper library for Web Api routing in .NET!

Features:
* Based on either an `IHttpHandler` or an `IHttpAsyncHandler`
* Route with backbone-style or regexes, into closures (delegates) or interfaces

This library has moved from `dg.Utilities` (on https://github.com/danielgindi/dg.Utilities), with some breaking changes.  
So replace all `dg.Utilities.WebApiServices` with `Webapi.net`.
